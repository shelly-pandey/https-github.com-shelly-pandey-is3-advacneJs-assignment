//Javascript code that prints out (using `console.log`) a sequence of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 (one million) without blocking the interactions with the browser.
For example, while that piece of Javascript is running, mouse, keyboard events etc should work fine .

function loopTimeout() {
    let i = 0;
    let interval = setInterval(function () {
        i++;

        if (i == 1000000) {
            clearInterval(interval);
        }
        console.log(`For Loop Number: ${i}`);
    }, 1000);

}
loopTimeout();
